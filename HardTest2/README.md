  It is an error due to docker/devpod container and workspace creation. Though it does not cause any problem but this experience can for sure be smoothen.

 I am not sure exactly why this message is shown but graph are created with this error message. It might not be so smooth for new users.

#### Experince

During my experience with Positron, I found that while it provides a lightweight and container-friendly environment for R development, it did not quite match the seamless workflow and user experience of RStudio. Several challenges arose, particularly with R Markdown files, where knitting documents did not work. Additionally, there were difficulties in installing and managing packages, which might led to issues. Building R packages within the environment also presented  obstacles that required additional troubleshooting. From a user experience perspective, it has potential, but there are areas where improvements could be enhance such as better error handling and a more intuitive interface. While it serves as a functional alternative, further refinements could make it a more user-friendly tool for R developers.
